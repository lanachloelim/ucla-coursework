Please rewrite the following code and fix the security vulnerability. Here are a few examples.
Function Name: disk_seqf_stop
Vulnerability: cwe-416
Code:
static void disk_seqf_stop(struct seq_file *seqf, void *v)
{
    struct class_dev_iter *iter = seqf->private;

    /* stop is called even after start failed :-( */
    if (iter) {
        class_dev_iter_exit(iter);
        kfree(iter);
    }
}

Explanation: cwe-416 is use after free. In this case, we freeded iter which is also the object pointed to by seqf->private. However, we should set it to NULL instead of allowing it to dangle, preventing undefined behavior.
Answer:
static void disk_seqf_stop(struct seq_file *seqf, void *v)
{
    struct class_dev_iter *iter = seqf->private;

    /* stop is called even after start failed :-( */
    if (iter) {
        class_dev_iter_exit(iter);
        kfree(iter);
        seqf->private = NULL;
    }
}
