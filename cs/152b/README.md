| Lab | Description |
|---|---|
| **0** | Built a simple 4-bit counter on the FPGA board. |
| **1** | Designed and implemented a 16-bit asynchronous ALU and a 32 16-bit register file using structural and behavioral Verilog. |
| **2** | Designed a traffic light controller using a finite state machine (FSM) in Verilog. |
| **3** | Implemented serial communication between a MicroBlaze processor on an FPGA board and the PC terminal. |
| **Final Project** | Implemented a multi-camera filtering system on an FPGA platform, designed to capture images from a video stream and apply zero or more filters to the output. |
