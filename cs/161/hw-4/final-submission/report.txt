3. If the instance is satisfiable, then we can find a solution for the coloring problem. However, if the instance is not satisfiable, we can not find a solution for the coloring problem.

Results of RSat: -1 -28 -27 -26 25 -21 -9 -5 -24 -23 22 -18 -2 -14 -20 -19 17 -13 -16 15 -11 -12 10 -6 -8 7 -3 4 0.
Positive integers are 25, 22, 17, 15, 10, 7, 4.
Positive integers indicate that the corresponding variable (node and color pair) is true, which means the node is assigned that color.

Using the formula for Variable Index = (n-1)*k+c,
Node 1: Color 4
Node 2: Color 3
Node 3: Color 2
Node 4: Color 3
Node 5: Color 1
Node 6: Color 2
Node 7: Color 1

4. The minimum number of colors required to properly color graph 2 is 8. We see in the following output that 7 colors is unsatisfiable, whereas 8 colors is satisfiable.
