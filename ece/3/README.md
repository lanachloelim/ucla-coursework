# UCLA EC ENGR 3: Intro to Electrical Engineering

Labs and projects for EC ENGR 3: Intro to Electrical Engineering (Prof. Dennis Briggs, UCLA Spring 2023). 

---

### Lab 1  
Explored the use of the Analog Discovery 2 (AD2) Impedance Analyzer to measure resistor and capacitor values, apply the voltage divider principle, and investigate the effects of circuit loading.

### Lab 2  
Learned how to use an oscilloscope and function generator to analyze periodic signals.

### Lab 3  
Experimented with LEDs, phototransistors, and their application in sensor circuits—key components for the line follower car project.

### Lab 4  
Set up the hardware and software environment for programming the car using the Texas Instruments Robot System Learning Kit (RSLK). Familiarized ourselves with RSLK’s components (e.g., MSP432 microcontroller, motors, sensors), installed and configured the Arduino IDE and required drivers, and uploaded our first example programs to the car.

### Final Project  
Line follower car.
